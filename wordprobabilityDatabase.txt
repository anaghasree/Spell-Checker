Still in its place, on a shelf in Changez's study: a certain copper-- and-
brass lamp, reputed to have the power of wish fulfilment, but as yet
(because never rubbed) untested. Somewhat tarnished now, it looked
down upon its dying owner; and was observed, in its turn, by his only
son. Who was sorely tempted, for an instant, to get it down, rub three
times, and ask the turbanned djinni for a magic spell . . . however,
Salahuddin left the lamp where it was. There was no place for djinns or
ghouls or afreets here; no spooks or fancies could be permitted. No
magic formulae; just the impotence of the pills.
i want a key.
